Those images caused so much emotion that in a few months we began to see videos and photos on all social networks of different types of wings and people practicing this strange sport. Well, it hasn't been long before we can see the rise of this sport and see countless sails all over the beaches and lakes. Without a doubt a sport that will leave many fans.",
